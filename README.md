# Multivariate abundance model for estimating interactions between communities and influences of known variables (environmental disturbances, sampling design, biological factors including functional traits). 

Codes associated to the paper "Coral Reef Community Changes in Karimunjawa National Park, Indonesia: Assessing the Efficacy of Management in the Face of Local and Global Stressors" published in Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. In this study, we estimated the influences of management zoning and bleaching impacts on five benthic groups (hard coral, soft coral, algae, sponge and sediment).
